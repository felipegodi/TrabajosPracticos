# Applied Data Visualization with R and ggplot2
This course introduces you to the world of data visualization by talking about the basic features of ggplot2. Learn all about setting up the R environment and then begin exploring the features of ggplot2. Grammar of graphics and geometric objects are the fundamentals you must know before you dive deep into the plotting techniques. Read and discover what are layers, scales, coordinates, and themes, and explore how you can use them to transform your data into aesthetical graphs. Learn the simple plots, such as histograms, and then some advanced plots, such as superimposing plots and density plots. Learn to plot trends, correlations, and statistical summaries. After reading this course, your data visualizations will wow clients.


## What you will learn
* Set up the R environment and RStudio
* Distinguish the types of variables and use best practices to visualize them
* Change visualization defaults to reveal more information about data
* Implement the grammar of graphics in ggplot2 such as scales and faceting
* Build complex, aesthetic visualizations with ggplot2 analysis methods
* Logically and systematically explore complex relationships
* Compare variables in a single visual, with advanced plotting methods

### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: 2.6 GHz or higher, preferably multi-core
* **Memory**: 8GB RAM
* **Hard disk**: 35GB or more 
* An Internet connection



### Software requirements
Youâ€™ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Operating System: Windows (8 or higher).
* R (latest version)
* RStudio (latest version)
